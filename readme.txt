Tennis court bookings is a comprehensive booking system specifically designed for tennis courts.

== Description ==
Tennis Court Bookings come in 4 modules ranging from our free "lite" version to a comprehensive tennis court booking, coaching and payment system.

This is how it works:
You simply set some variables such as:
*   What days of the week the courts are open.
*   What special days the courts are closed.
*   How far in advance your visitors can book a court.
*   Your opening hours.
*   Name your booking system.
Visitors then just click on the date they want to book a court, pick the court they want to book and the start and finish time.
This information is then locked in and the visitor received an email confirmation they can bring with them to the courts as evidence that they booked a specific court.  
 
Features and Benefits

*   Enable/disable to email a standard message to your visitor confirming the booking. This can be printed and taken to the courts as evidence of the booking.
